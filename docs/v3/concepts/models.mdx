title: 'Supported Models'
description: 'DroidRun is **LLM agnostic**, which means you can use every LLM provider there is.

Under the hood, DroidRun leverages [LlamaIndex LLM providers](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/api_reference/llms/) to provide seamless integration with all major language model providers. This means you can easily switch between different providers or use multiple providers simultaneously depending on your needs.

## Install LLM Provider
```bash
# Install the package for your preferred LLM Provider
