## Security Checks

To ensure the security of the codebase, we have integrated security checks using `bandit` and `safety`. These tools help identify potential security issues in the code and dependencies.

### Running Security Checks

Before submitting any code, please run the following security checks:

1. **Bandit**: A tool to find common security issues in Python code.
   ```bash
   bandit -r droidrun
   ```

2. **Safety**: A tool to check your installed dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.
   ```bash
   safety check
   ```

You can also run both checks using the provided script:
```bash
python -m droidrun.tools.security_check
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Update documentation for any modified functionality
2. Update the changelog if applicable
3. Get at least one code review from a maintainer
4. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

## Release Process

Releases are handled by the maintainers. Version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
